Scooter purchase within an age group of 20-40:

Do:

1.I will search in google for various scooter models.
2.I will compare different features and prices of different models.
3.I will ask for recommendations from friends and relatives.
4.I will also check for recommendations in online websites.
5.I will also try to test ride scooter from any rental services.

Feels:

1.not feeling comfortable from asking so many ways.
